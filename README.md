# r/RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial - in Kotlin

At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod). I'm following along in Kotlin.

The weeks in the tutorial I've matched up to branches:

* [Week 1](tree/week1): Drawing the UI and moving an `@` around
* [Week 2](tree/week2): Groundwork for the concept of a level
* [Week 3](tree/week3): A dungeon generator with rooms and connecting tunnels
* [Week 4](tree/week4): "Fog of war" to manage player visibility
